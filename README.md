# An ultra-fast exhaustive-search based sgRNA design method

Whole genome sgRNA design database for human and mouse. Due to the limites of file size, the bam files are uploaded to http://enhancer.sdsc.edu/CREST-web/

### Description

We developed an exhaustive search algorithm(CREST-web) to calculate all off-targets accurately. CREST-web calculates genome-wide off-target candidates in 7 hours using 8 CPUs. And we introduced a new scoring function to evaluate the off-targets effects considering both of the number and the positions of the mismatches. The outputs in standard SAM/BAM format.
